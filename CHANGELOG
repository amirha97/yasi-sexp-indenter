	* yasi.py (trim_extra_whitespace): All whitespace after opening brackets was
		being stripped concatenating literal bracket characters with the tokens
		after them.

Nov 20-2013 03:32:20
	* yasi.py (main): Fixed a test condition that identified the start of a
		comment line wrongly.


Nov 20-2013 05:02:26

	* yasi.py (is_macro_name): Classifies a token with `def` as a macro and
		hance a two space indenter so that it handles macros with full namespace 
		qualification like `yacc:define-parser`

Nov 20-2013 05:55:17
	* yasi.py (main): Fixed wrong detection of comment and symbol regions.
					  It needed to be updated at two places.
Nov 21-2013 12:32:54
	* yasi.py (main): Major refactoring. Put all the code in functions. 12 
					  in the toplevel and 11 in the Indenter class. The program 
					  can now indent strings. 

					  Documented those functions.
Nov 21-2013 16:29:42
	* yasi.py (Indenter.trim): Removed functions:
			remove_btw_brackets [Indenter]
			remove_leading [Indenter]
			remove_extra [Indenter]
			remove_before_closing_bracket [Indenter]
			remove_after_opening_bracket [Indenter]
		in favour of regular expressions with back references to 
		trim whitespace in code.

Nov 22-2013 21:53:45
	* yasi.py (Indenter.pad_leading_whitespace): It doesn't modify an empty lines.
			  (Indenter.all_whitespace): New function that determines if a string has
										 nothing else but whitespace
			  (Indenter.split_preserve): Doesn't rstrip everything, only the separator. 

Nov 22-2013 22:09:18
	* yasi.py (Indenter.trim): Fixed regex that separated the splicing comma from the symbol
							   after it.

Nov 22-2013 23:17:32
	* yasi.py (indent_file): Backs up the file only if the file contents are different from

Nov 22-2013 23:54:50
	* yasi.py (indent_code): Wrong detection of string endings in the case of 3 or more backslashes 
							 preceding a double quote.
							
							Renamed variable untouchable_region to in_symbol_region

Nov 23-2013 09:45:31
	* yasi.py (main): Renamed lists `positions` and `string_positions` to `quote_locations` and
					  `brackect_locations` respectively. It felt more meaningful that way since 
					  technically you can't store the position of a string but it's beginning and
					  and end at best.

Nov 23-2013 11:11:31
	* yasi.py (after_indentation, indent_code): A list is not necessary to track
				unclosed strings, simply use a variable e.g `last_quote_location`

Nov 23-2013 12:28:53
	* yasi.py (handle_warning): A new function called when a warning is issued. The
							 functions code was previously duplicated in several
							functions in the code.
		   (indented_code): Can now handle newLISP's multiline strings.
Nov 23-2013 12:52:01
	* yasi.py (after_indentation): Warnings on unclosed multiline strings for
								   newLISP
Nov 23-2013 16:11:07
	* yasi.py (indent_code): Prevent evaluation of escape characters in
							 newLISP's raw strings that would cause false warnings 
							of unclosed strings.
Nov 24-2013 09:38:19
	* yasi.py (indent_code): False detection of multiline string when a pipe is encountered 
							 in a newLISP raw string.
Nov 24-2013 14:48:25
	* yasi.py (indenter.indent): New function broken off from function
								 indent_code for length reasons.

Nov 24-2013 15:20:52
	* yasi.py (indent_code): Wrong calculation of a bracket's real position

Nov 24-2013 15:36:43
	* yasi.py (indenter.indent): Returns NullObject when zero level is found. 

Nov 24-2013 16:38:01
	* yasi.py (indent_code): Passes filename without path to `after_indentation`
							 causing it to fail when absolute and relative paths 
							are used
Nov 24-2013 21:45:09
	* yasi.py (pad_leading_whitespace): Wrong calculation of indent level due to 
							the zero level being added on every line in nocompact 
							mode.
Nov 25-2013 22:09:20
	* yasi.py (find_first_arg_pos): Multiline comments shouldn't be treated as
									arguments to functions.

Nov 26-2013 14:52:52

									matching brackets.

Nov 26-2013 15:58:43
	* yasi.py (indenter.indent): Comments can now be indented with the `--indent-comments` option
								 One can now specify the default indent level.

	* yasi.py (issue_warning): All warnings are handled by this function 

Dec 02-2013 00:26:09
	* yasi.py (indent_code): Square and curly brackets should ignored when the dialect in
							 use is newLISP or Common Lisp.

Dec 02-2013 17:51:01
	* yasi.py (indent_code): Vectors indent by one space
							 Sharp sign before semi colons in Scheme should not
							be considered as comments in order to avoid errors
							about unclosed brackets.
